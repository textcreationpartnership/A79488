            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But further con≈øidering, that the ≈øaid Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his, were divulged in print, and might do much hurt among≈øt ≈øome ignorant people, <hi>who would do better if they knew better;</hi> I thought it meet to help to take off this new vizard, put upon the Anabapti≈øts old out-worn arguments, and ≈øo to pull down this little tottering turret of Babel; becau≈øe that in this fal≈øe fire, and light of the ≈øparks of the≈øe crackling thornes, the makers thereof delight ≈øtill to walke, and ≈øome are yet deluded, by ≈øuch frothie Divinitie, and ≈ømokie clouds of ≈øubl me ≈øophi≈øtry; without due triall of them, by the light of Gods Word; or weighing them in the balance of the Sanctuary.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, in obedience to God, and love to his people; I have here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to u≈øe my talent in vindicating the lawfulne≈ø≈øe of <hi>Chri≈øtians Bapti≈øme,</hi> rai≈øed with them out of the <hi>grave</hi> of the <hi>Apo≈øta≈øie</hi> of the <hi>man</hi> of <hi>≈øinne,</hi> which hath been for many yeers, in which Apo≈øtate e≈øtate, and wretched condition, the name of God hath been greatly profained, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitutions (though not de≈øtroyed) yet highly abu≈øed, to the de≈øtruction of many ≈øouls; out of which ≈øtate, God hath called ≈øome, who have obeyed his voyce, and come out of <hi>Babel</hi> to <hi>Sion;</hi> and are as dearly beloved of God, as the penitent <hi>I≈øraelites,</hi> whom God in former time brought from <hi>Jeroboams apo≈øta≈øie</hi> to <hi>Judah,</hi> where they kept the fea≈øt, unto the Lord, and were both <hi>young,</hi> and <hi>old,</hi> accepted of him, though they retained the <hi>Circumci≈øion</hi> which they received in that apo≈øtate e≈øtate, where there was neither <hi>true vi≈øible Church, mini≈øtry, wor≈øhip, nor government,</hi> but all <hi>diabolicall,</hi> and <hi>Apo≈øtaticall:</hi> yet (God having re≈øerved his own ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance pure unto him≈øelf) the evill of the manner being repented of, by them;
<pb facs="tcp:155922:3"/> the thing it ≈øelf was not commanded to be admini≈øtred upon them again.</p>
            <p>And ≈øurely, God could have commanded that Circum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But Mr. <hi>A.

            <p>But it would not have been ami≈ø≈øe, if he had well con≈øidered (for abridgement of his work) that <hi>bapti≈øme,</hi> being (by his own confe≈ø≈øion) a <hi>great</hi> ordinance of the <hi>New Te≈øtament;</hi> To make it le≈ø≈øe generall, or le≈ø≈øe durable then <hi>Circumci≈øion,</hi> or inferiour thereunto, would be to make Chri≈øt le≈ø≈øe faithfull in his hou≈øe then <hi>Mo≈øes;</hi> and inferiour to him: But <hi>bapti≈øme</hi> is more generall then <hi>Circumci≈øion:</hi> And <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then <hi>Mo≈øes, and Bapti≈øme is as durable as Circumci≈øion.</hi> Therefore ≈øeeing Circumci≈øion was not worne out by tho≈øe; Bapti≈øme is not worne out by the≈øe.</p>
            <p>Think not (Chri≈øtian Reader) that I intend to plead for the Apo≈øtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any of her daughters, or for their <hi>mini≈øtry, wor≈øhip,</hi> or <hi>Government!</hi> So farre am I from this, that I utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, and di≈øclaime the ≈øame; and leave the Ju≈øtification of them to the di≈øpo≈øition of tho≈øe who account them no wor≈øe then <hi>Heathens</hi> that never knew the truth; and ≈øeek to le≈ø≈øen their ≈øinne by labouring to vindicate their ≈øuppo≈øed innocencie, teaching them [in this] to plead <hi>ignoramus,</hi> and not guiltie, when they are ju≈øtly accu≈øed for committing of <hi>≈øacriledge.</hi> Yea, and <hi>Gods</hi> definitive ≈øentence pronounced again≈øt them, and his just judgements executed (and daily executing) upon them, as appeareth at this very day, ≈øince the ≈øharp arrows of the <hi>Almighty</hi> have been (and are ≈øtill) ≈øo generally ≈øcattered abroad, to the de≈øtruction, and ruination of tho≈øe per≈øons; not onely for their abu≈øe of common meats, and drinks, and other temporall ble≈ø≈øings; but chiefly (and above all) for the abu≈øe and prophanation of ≈øpirituall things, as (the prophanation of) Gods holy word, and ordinances, which they di≈øtribute to all ≈øorts of ≈øinners that come under
<pb facs="tcp:155922:3"/> the notion of a verball profe≈ø≈øion, though very vile in their life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øation. All which is of us not to be le≈ø≈øened, or excu≈øed, as if it were not <hi>≈øacriledge</hi> (or theft in an high degree) but rather to be lamented, that tho≈øe per≈øons who draw neer unto God with their mouthes, and outwardly pretend to ≈øtand for Chri≈øt, and fight for his true Religion; (taking upon them to defend the ≈øame, ≈øome with the Word, others with the ≈øword) again≈øt tho≈øe who do oppo≈øe them) ≈øhould have their hearts ≈øo farre aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from God, as ≈øo much to take his holy Name in vaine, and prophane his Sabbaths, as tho≈øe do who on that day powre out their meat-offerings and drink-offerings, in the idolatrous high places, which being a defilement unto the Land, are by the laws of God de≈øtinated to de≈øtruction.

            </p>

And then exhorts the people to give thanks to God, for that it hath plea≈øed him to regenerate the infants with his holy Spirit, and received them for his own children by adoption, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the≈øe premi≈øes you would infer that the bapti≈øme is fal≈øe, which ground of yours is very weak; yea the ground of your rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ami≈ø≈øe, and contrary to rea≈øon.</p>
            <p>For it is no right arguing to bring the mixing of their traditions as a nihilation of Gods in≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>And their confe≈ø≈øion <hi>that all men be born and conceived in ≈øin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the words of Chri≈øt, and the exhortation to call upon God the Father through Je≈øus Chri≈øt, that he will give them that of his mercy which (they confe≈ø≈øe) by nature they cannot have, that they might be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øed with water and the holy Gho≈øt.</hi> Doth not argue that the bapti≈øme is not Gods ordinance, for it is neither their high conceptions, or great e≈øtimations, or ≈øuch verball pronuntiations that doth de≈øtroy or make void Gods holy in≈øtitutions: yet it is a prophanation of the Name of God, and ≈øo it is of the ordinance, becau≈øe the <hi>per≈øons</hi> who admini≈øter the ≈øame, are <hi>Idolaters,</hi> and the <hi>≈øubjects</hi> upon whom it is <hi>admini≈øtred,</hi> are the ≈øeed of <hi>Apo≈øtates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is it their be≈øeeching God of his infinite mercies, <hi>that he will mercifully look upon the≈øe children, and ≈øanctifie them, and wa≈øh them with the holy Gho≈øt;</hi> that will di≈øanull the ordinance, and make it of none effect. Neither doth their praying, <hi>that the children may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Gods wrath, and that they may be received into the Ark of

Neither doth their acknowledging of bapti≈øme to be Gods, and to be holy, and there praying for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of ≈øins for the Infants by ≈øpirituall regeneration, (nor their a≈øcribing regeneration to the holy Spirit) prove the bapti≈øme there admini≈øtred to be no true bapti≈øme.</p>
            <p>And it is not their <hi>≈øprinkling</hi> or ca≈øting water upon the face of the <hi>children</hi> that maketh a nullitie of the ordinance; though he <hi>without blu≈øhing</hi> ≈øay afterwards, that the children be regenerated; for whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he blu≈øh or not blu≈øh, that is not materiall; to prove the point which you brought it for.</p>
            <p>And though the exhortation which the Mini≈øter gives to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together with the re≈øt <hi>agreeth with their Catechi≈øe,</hi> the particulars whereof (concerning infants regeneration) though they were confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the≈øe Fathers<note n="*" place="margin">Ierome, Augu≈øtin, Zanchus, Peter Martyr, <hi>Dr</hi> Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticar.</note> (which you have cited) to be noted<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 3.</note> in≈øtead of many more, yet it doth not argue, but that the <hi>bapti≈øme</hi> holdeth firme, though in re≈øpect of the manner we allow it not, neither their additions thereunto; and though it be done by a <hi>wrong admini≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour</hi> upon an <hi>apo≈øtate,</hi> yet if that <hi>Apo≈øtate</hi> return from his <hi>apo≈øta≈øie,</hi> the evill of the manner being repented of, the action hath no need to be done over again, neither doth <hi>God</hi> ≈øo require it, any more then he required the <hi>apo≈øtate I≈øraelites</hi> (when they returned) to be <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øed</hi> again; this you cannot deny, except you could prove <hi>bapti≈øme</hi> to be le≈ø≈øe durable then <hi>circumci≈øion;</hi> as if <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> were le≈ø≈øe faithfull in his hou≈øe then <hi>Mo≈øes.</hi>

            <p>Again you ≈øay, <hi>the end for which Infants are bapti≈øed in the Church of England, is to regenerate them, and that they may be born anew, and accordingly it is concluded in the Catechi≈øme;</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But after all this you make a ≈øimple objection on their behalfe, thus<note n="b" place="margin">Lin 21. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Infants are elected, and therefore they may be bapti≈øed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which you an≈øwer<note n="c" place="margin">Lin. 23.24.</note>, that <hi>all Infants are not elected, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all infants ought not to be bapti≈øed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I reply, that as the objection is without di≈øtinction, ≈øo is your an≈øwer thereunto; and therefore except they were explained, it were folly to an≈øwer either of them. For a man may be in Gods ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret election a <hi>Saint,</hi> and yet an <hi>Idolater,</hi> and ≈øo are the <hi>infants</hi> of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous parents <hi>idolaters,</hi> (in regard of their vi≈øible e≈øtate) yet we know not but that <hi>God</hi> hath elected divers of them, and will in his due time manife≈øt them.</p>
            <p>But you make another weak objection for them: for you ≈øay, <hi>they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:155922:8"/> will reply, That in regard ≈øome infants are elected, and none can ≈øay that this or that particular infant is not elected, therefore Bapti≈øme mu≈øt be admini≈øtred unto all, becau≈øe we may not deny the elect their priviledges, for fear of giving to others, that which belongs not to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this mad and fooli≈øh objection (which you father upon others) you make <hi>an≈øwer, that if it be a warrantable ground for you to admini≈øter bapti≈øme to all infants, becau≈øe that ≈øome particular infants are elected, then by the ≈øame rea≈øon it will follow, that bapti≈øme may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be admini≈øtred to every man and woman in the world, becau≈øe among≈øt them al≈øo we may judge that ≈øome are elected: But this</hi> (≈øay you) <hi>contradicteth the order and rule of Chri≈øt.</hi> (Matth. 28.19.

               <note n="*" place="margin">P. 8 l. 6. 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>To which I reply: That [≈øome] <hi>infants</hi> are <hi>elected</hi> cannot be ju≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied; But to admini≈øter <hi>bapti≈øme</hi> to [all] infants for fear of omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to any of the <hi>elect,</hi> is to do evill that good may come thereof.</p>
            <p>Moreover, all the <hi>elect</hi> are not priviledged to have the outward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of <hi>bapti≈øme,</hi> nor any of them till ≈øuch time as they are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øted unto us to be vi≈øible <hi>Saints;</hi> Again, we know <hi>Judas I≈øcariot,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> were <hi>bapti≈øed,</hi> though not elected.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>rea≈øon</hi> which is annexed to the <hi>objection,</hi> is non≈øen≈øe, which is <hi>for fear of giving to others that which belongs not to them:</hi> for in admini≈øtring <hi>Bapti≈øme</hi> to [all] they give unto others (be≈øides the <hi>elect</hi>) that which belongeth not to them; therefore ≈øuch <hi>manner</hi> of rea≈øoning will not ≈øtand; I ≈øeldome have heard the like rea≈øoning, except it were among≈øt tho≈øe who deny <hi>Infants bapti≈øme</hi> to be Gods holy in≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>Now in your an≈øwer to this you cro≈ø≈øe your ≈øelf; in <hi>pag.</hi> 7. lin. 9, 10, 11. where you ≈øay, that God hath not ≈øaid he will de≈øtroy any <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants</hi> in hell, and it would be cen≈øorious for any to judge that they ≈øhall be damned, and yet you grant concerning per≈øons of yeers that they are under the cen≈øure of damnation. Therefore by your own ground you cannot ≈øo freely <hi>bapti≈øe</hi> all men and women as you can all infants, and therefore it appears that what you build up with one hand, you throw down with the other.</p>
            <p>In the ≈øecond part of your an≈øwer to this <hi>objection,</hi> you grant <hi>(for arguments ≈øake) that bapti≈øme is to be admini≈øtred upon the elect before they manife≈øt faith,</hi> in which affirmation, you want a di≈øtinction, and explanation, for you ought to have made a di≈øtinction betweene <hi>faith inherent,</hi> and <hi>faith profe≈ø≈øed;</hi> that is, you ≈øhould have declared
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:155922:9"/> that faith may be <hi>inherent</hi> in ≈øome onely; and <hi>profe≈ø≈øed</hi> in others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that all that <hi>profe≈ø≈øe faith verbally</hi> have not faith <hi>really;</hi> and all that have <hi>faith really,</hi> do not <hi>profe≈ø≈øe</hi> it <hi>verbally,</hi> or manife≈øt it them≈øelves <hi>actually.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, you ≈øhould have explained your ≈øelf, whether you meane by the <hi>elect,</hi> all the <hi>elect,</hi> or but <hi>≈øome</hi> of them, all which you have omitted: wherefore I <hi>omit to an≈øwer you till you further explain your ≈øelf.</hi> But in the conclu≈øion you affirm, <hi>that its true faith onely mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øted, and made known by confe≈ø≈øion of the mouth, that gives the elect ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion to Bapti≈øme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I an≈øwer, that though we cannot know <hi>invi≈øibly</hi> becau≈øe it is the onely office of the <hi>invi≈øible Spirit,</hi> to whom all things are <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible,</hi> yet we may <hi>judge</hi> of <hi>invi≈øible things,</hi> by <hi>vi≈øible demon≈øtrations;</hi> as the <hi>Saints</hi> before us have done; ≈øo <hi>God</hi> leaving unto us a <hi>rule</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to judge the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> to be <hi>elected,</hi> it is want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and charitie which maketh ≈øome per≈øons that they cannot judge ≈øo of them, nor put a difference between the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>heathens</hi> and the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleeving parents;</hi> for the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> in the time of the <hi>Law</hi> could not be <hi>circumci≈øed</hi> (according to <hi>Gods</hi> will) without a <hi>confe≈ø≈øion;</hi> but if their <hi>parents</hi> made a <hi>confe≈ø≈øion,</hi> it was ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to bring both them and their <hi>infants</hi> to have right to <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øion,</hi> and tho≈øe <hi>infants</hi> were <hi>Jews</hi> (that is, <hi>confe≈ø≈øors</hi>) though they could not make a <hi>verball confe≈ø≈øion</hi> them≈øelves <hi>actually</hi> and the like priviledge the <hi>infants</hi> of <hi>beleevers</hi> have now under the <hi>Go≈øpel,</hi> to have <hi>bapti≈øme,</hi> as the other had <hi>circumci≈øion,</hi> which is one and the ≈øame in effect.

            <p>Con≈øider, I pray you, that <hi>Paul</hi> after the Lord had ≈ømitten him down<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 9.4.</note>, was without his ≈øight, but was led unto Dama≈øcus to the hou≈øe of <hi>Judas,</hi> and there remained, in a weak condition, (not having his ≈øight) nor taking any food for the ≈øpace of three dayes<note n="e" place="margin">Ver 8 9.11.</note>, his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die being ≈øo enfeebled<note n="f" place="margin">Ver. 18.19.</note> ≈øhall we think that it would not have been an act of crueltie (Egyptian like) to have dipped him over head and eares in cold water? which thing I ≈øuppo≈øe you hold.

            <p>And God him≈øelf bapti≈øed the children of I≈ørael in the Red ≈øea, not by overwhelming them with water, as he did the Egyptians, but by ≈øprinkling or infu≈øing water upon them<note n="g" place="margin">P≈øal 16.17.19.20.</note>; and yet <hi>Paul</hi> gives it the denomination of <hi>bapti≈øme</hi>

            <p>The fir≈øt part of this argument is proved from <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16.</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond, namely, that the application of the Go≈øpel apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to the≈øe infants is proved.</p>

            <p>For how can the infants be ≈øaid to be godly, in vi≈øibilitie, [either by action, or imputation] ≈øo long as their parents are vi≈øible idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, either per≈øonally, or ≈øtatively: Surely, where the guilt of <hi>originall ≈øinne</hi> is not to be judged to be <hi>imputatively</hi> done away by <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> the vi≈øible <hi>≈øeal</hi> of the <hi>forgivene≈ø≈øe</hi> of that <hi>≈øinne</hi> ought not to be applyed, but their <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>originall ≈øinne</hi> is not [in Gods <hi>revealed</hi> will] decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (and therefore is not of us to be judged) to be imputatively done away by Chri≈øt.</p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>bapti≈øme</hi> (which is the vi≈øible ≈øeal of the <hi>forgivene≈ø≈øe</hi> of that <hi>≈øinne,</hi>) ought not to be applyed unto ≈øuch per≈øons.</p>
            <p>And though we affirm, that we had no right to <hi>bapti≈øme</hi> in the ≈øtate of <hi>Apo≈øta≈øie,</hi> (our <hi>parents</hi> being then Antichri≈øtians) yet it will not follow (as you would inferre) that we had not the <hi>bapti≈øme</hi> of <hi>Chri≈øt:</hi> neither by our own grounds, nor from any ground you have, or (I ≈øuppo≈øe) can alledge again≈øt the ≈øame; And therefore there is no place for you to build any ju≈øt <hi>con≈øequence</hi> that we are <hi>unbapti≈øed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons;</hi> yea though you upon this unnece≈ø≈øarie <hi>con≈øequence</hi> build an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, that our own <hi>bapti≈øme is clearly made void even from</hi> our <hi>own grounds;</hi> and upon this conceit of yours, you ask <hi>how then can their children be now bapti≈øed in the right of ≈øuch parents, who are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bapti≈øed them≈øelves?</hi> and ≈øo you take for granted, that which you cannot prove.
